"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI technologies have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task over time without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in AI and machine learning, leading to the development of advanced systems like self-driving cars, natural language processing, and recommendation engines. As these technologies continue to advance, their impact on society and the economy is expected to grow, posing both opportunities and challenges."
